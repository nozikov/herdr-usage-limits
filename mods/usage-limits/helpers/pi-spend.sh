# 8 days, oldest first, and exits:
#   <ISO timestamp> <totalTokens>
#
# Pi has no stats command; its session files hold the whole conversation. Only the
# reply's timestamp and token count leave this script, never message text. Text in them
# is JSON-escaped, so \"role\" can't match the "role" looked for here. The files are
# read, Pi itself is never run. Adding the numbers up by day is providers/pi.js's job.

# Exit: 0 = printed (nothing when there are no replies), 127 = no sessions folder (Pi not
# installed), 1 = the sessions folder itself can't be read. A folder or file in it that
# can't be read is left out; the others are still counted.

# A message line: {"type":"message",...,"timestamp":"<ISO>","message":{"role":...}}.
# The line's own timestamp comes before "message":{ (the reply has a numeric one of its
# own inside, and a tool call's arguments can hold anything). The first "role" is the
# message's. The reply's "usage" is one of the message's own fields, after its content: the
# last "usage" counts only if, from it to the end, the line closes exactly the message and
# itself (strings dropped first); inside a tool call's arguments it closes more, and a ]
# among them, and the reply adds no line. Without totalTokens, its parts are added up.
